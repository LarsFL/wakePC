# A simple way to wake your pc using WOL with a locally hosted website

Host this locally while port forwarded and you can turn your pc (with WOL enabled) on from anywhere.
Only setup required is choosing a password, entering your PC's mac-adress and setting your PC up to allow WOL.
Furthermore you must install the package 'wakeonlan' (example is for linux distro's)

```sudo apt-get install wakeonlan```
